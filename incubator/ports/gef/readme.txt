This initial port of Draw2D, GEF and Zest for RAP is still under development. 
It is currently based on an unstable fork of the GEF project but will be updated for the Indigo release.  
It requires changes that are forthcoming in the RAP target platform itself and will currently not function.
It is currently checked into HEAD so that others may begin to analyze for use in their environments.
This file will be updated when the status changes.
